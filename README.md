# Introduction

This project is a classification task where we are tasked to classify 12 labels (['US', 'FR', 'CA', 'GB', 'ES', 'IT',
'PT', 'NL','DE', 'AU', 'NDF' (no destination found)]) on new users.
It takes a long time for users to look for their first travel destination. With over 34, 000+ cities across 190+
countries to choose from, users have a hard time deciding where to travel to. Airbnb does not have the
resources to provide personalized content to users to aid in their decision making.
Having a prediction of where the user will travel during their first trip will allow Airbnb to reduce the time for
users to make their booking. Airbnb manage demand better by forecasting where users will book their first trip.
With increasing competition within the travel industry, Airbnb wants to strategically improve its user
experience. Currently, users are taking a long time to decide on their first travel destination. Having a
prediction of where the user will travel for his/her first trip allows Airbnb to offer a more personalized content for
each user. By effectively matching user preference, the users will find it easier book their first trip instead of
sieving through 34,000+ cities across 190+ countries presented to them in the application
